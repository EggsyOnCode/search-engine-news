  "content": "The Battle at Wounded Knee is a significant battle in American history , as it put an end to the Indian Wars and is marked as the last official defeat of the Native Americans .\nBut what \u2019 s not taught in history lessons is that Wounded Knee was one of the first federally backed gun confiscations in the history of the United States , and it ended in the massacre of nearly 300 unarmed people .\nDuring the late 19th century , American Indians were allowed to purchase and carry firearms , just as white men were .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans from possessing firearms , yet that natural right was violated by government forces at Wounded Knee .\nAnd once the guns were confiscated , the battle ensued .\nWhen we look at the issues surrounding gun confiscation , Wounded Knee gives us an example of the devastation that an unarmed people can experience at the hands of their own government .\nThis battle serves as a reminder to fight against gun confiscation and the gun control legislation that can lead to it .\nAt the beginning of the 19th century , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on the land that is now the United States .\nBy the end of the century , the people diminished to less than 150,000 .\nThroughout the 1800s , these nomadic tribes were pushed from the open plains and forests into \u201c Indian Territories , \u201d places determined by the U.S. government .\nIt started during the Creek Indian War ( 1813-1815 ) , when American soldiers , led by Andrew Jackson , won nearly 20 million acres of land from the defeated Creek Indians .\nUnlike George Washington , who believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jackson favored an \u201c Indian Removal , \u201d and when president in 1830 , he signed the Indian Removal Act , which was the first of many U.S. legislations that did not grant the Native Americans the same rights as colonial European-Americans .\nDavy Crockett was the only delegate from Tennessee to vote against the act .\nThe Plains Indians , who lived in the plains between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains , weren \u2019 t as impacted by the U.S. government until later in the century , as U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d As people moved passed the Mississippi and into the Frontier , conflicts again arose between the Indians and Americans .\nIn an attempt at peace in 1851 , the first Fort Laramie Treaty was signed , which granted the Plain Indians about 150 million acres of land for their own use as the Great Sioux Reservation .\nThen , 13 years later , the size was greatly reduced to about 60 million acres in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 , which recreated the Great Sioux Reservation boundaries and proclaimed all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Black Hills , solely for the Sioux Nation .\nAs part of the treaty , no unauthorized non-Indian was to come into the reservation and the Sioux were allowed to hunt in unceded Indian territory beyond the reservation that stretched into North Dakota , Montana , Wyoming , Nebraska , and Colorado .\nIf any non-Indian wanted to settle on this unceded land , they could only do it with the permission of the Sioux .\nThat was until 1874 , when gold was discovered in South Dakota \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed between the Native Americans and the U.S. government were ignored as gold rushers invaded Indian Territory and issues arose , such as the Battle of the Little Bighorn .\nAs time went on , the American Indians continued to be pushed into smaller territories and their lives began to diminish .\nIn 1889 , the U.S. government issued the Dawes Act , which took the Black Hills from the Indians , broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five separate reservations , and took nine million acres and opened it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements .\nThe Native Americans were squeezed into these smaller territories and didn \u2019 t have enough game to support them .\nThe bison that had been a staple to their way of life were gone .\nTheir ancestral lands that sustained them were no longer theirs .\nThe resistance was over .\nThey were no longer free people , living amongst themselves , but \u201c Redskins \u201d confined by the \u201c white man \u201d in reservations they had been forced to , many against their will .\nWith all of the Sioux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divided up throughout South Dakota , the Indians were encouraged by the U.S. government to develop small farms .\nBut they were faced with poor , arid soil and a bad growing season , which led to a severely limited food supply in the year following the Dawes Act .\nA miscalculation in the census complicated matters even more when the population on the reservation was undercounted , leading to less supplies sent from the U.S. government .\nThe situation was beyond bleak and the Sioux people were starving .\nThat winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused a disproportionate number of Sioux children to die .\nAnd then in the summer of 1890 , a drought hit , destroying yet another season of crops and the people of Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were in dire condition .\nPerhaps it was these desolate circumstances that led to the spread of what is known as the Ghost Dance .\nBased on a vision experienced by a Sioux religious leader , the Ghost Dance was a spiritual ritual that was supposed to call the coming messiah , who would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man off of Indian lands , return the bison to the plains , and resurrect both their deceased and the life the Native Americans had once enjoyed .\nAlthough this was not a war dance , it was feared by those who believed the Indians were savages .\nOne such man was Daniel Royer , who arrived as the new agent on the Pine Ridge Reservation in October of 1890 .\nHe believed it to be a war dance and requested troops from President Benjamin Harrison on November 15th of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Indians are dancing in the snow and are wild and crazy .\nWe need protection and we need it now.\n\u201d Harrison granted the request and part of the 7th Cavalry arrived on November 20th , with orders to arrest several Sioux leaders .\nCommander James Forsyth led the troops .\nOn December 15th , the 7th Cavalry attempted to arrest Sitting Bull , the Sioux chief who annihilated Commander George Custer in the Battle of the Little Bighorn ( he also toured with Buffalo Bill \u2019 s Wild West Show and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , because he didn \u2019 t attempt to stop the Ghost Dance amongst his people .\nDuring the incident , Sitting Bull was shot and killed .\nThe Lakota at Pine Ridge began to get nervous and the tribe \u2019 s leader , Big Foot , practiced the Ghost Dance and had caught the attention of the federal agents .\nAfter hearing of Sitting Bull \u2019 s death , he and his tribe fled to the Badlands .\nThey were pursued by the 7th Cavalry for five days .\nBut Big Foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were peacefully intercepted at Wounded Knee Creek on December 28th .\nThe next morning , Col. Forsyth demanded that the tribe surrender their firearms .\nRifles were being turned over without issue until some of the Sioux men started a Ghost Dance and began throwing dirt into the air , as was customary to the dance .\nA few moments later , a Sioux man named Black Coyote refused to give up his rifle .\nIt \u2019 s been reported that the Indian was deaf , had recently purchased the rifle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier was demanding it .\nRegardless , the two began to skuffle and the gun discharged .\nThe 7th Cavalry , who was the reconstructed regiment of Custer , opened fire on the Lakota .\nAlong with their own weapons , they used four Hotchkiss guns , a revolving barrel machine gun that could fire 68 rounds per minute , devastating the entire tribe , which had just peacefully handed over their weapons .\nThe Sioux men , women , and children scattered , and the Cavalry pursued them .\nDead bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the firing ended , some two hours later , an estimated 300 Native Americans lay dead in the snow , at least half of them women and children .\nThose that didn \u2019 t die immediately froze to death during the oncoming blizzard .\nNearly a week later , on January 3 , 1891 , the Cavalry escorted a burial party to the banks of the Wounded Knee River and they buried 146 Lakota Indians in a single mass grave .\nOther bodies were found in the surrounding areas , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 Sioux .\nThe Massacre at Wounded Knee brought an end to the Indian Wars .\nThere was no more resistance .\nThe Ghost Dancing stopped .\nThe Native Americans had been beaten .\nBut the Cavalry \u2019 s attack was recognized as butchery , with Forsyth \u2019 s commanding officer , General Nelson Miles , calling it a \u201c criminal military blunder and a horrible massacre of women and children.\n\u201d However , President Harrison had an election around the corner and wasn \u2019 t in a position to look bad .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cavalry men were made out as heroes against the Indian \u201c savages.\n\u201d And in the Spring of 1891 , the president awarded the first of 20 Medals of Honor to the soldiers who disarmed then slaughtered the Sioux at Wounded Knee .\nIt \u2019 s been speculated that the 7th Cavalry , which again was regrouped after it was destroyed by Sitting Bull at Little Bighorn , was looking for a fight and deliberately sought revenge on the Native Americans .\nBlack Elk , one of the few Lakota survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1931 : \u201c I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw with eyes still young .\nAnd I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud , and was buried in the blizzard .\nA people \u2019 s dream died there.\n\u201d The Wounded Knee Massacre : The Forgotten History of the Native American Gun Confiscation originally appeared in the Resistance Library at Ammo.com .\nBecome a Patron !\nOr support us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post for truth , peace , and freedom news .\nFollow us on Telegram , HIVE , Flote , Minds , MeWe , Twitter , Gab and What Really Happened .\nProvide , Protect and Profit from what \u2019 s coming !\nGet a free issue of Counter Markets today .",
